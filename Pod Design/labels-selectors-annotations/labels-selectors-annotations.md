## Labels
Labels are properties attached to each item, so we can add properties to each item for their class, kind

## Selectors
helps us to filter these items.

Different types of objects are created in K8s - pods, Services, Replica Sets, Deployments etc.

Group objects by their type or view objects by application or by their functionality

## Annotations

While labels and selectors are used to group and select objects, annotations are used to record other details for informatory purpose.
eg: tool details like name, version, email id etc
