Blue-Green Deployment is a Deployment Strategy - a new version is deployed alongside the old version

so old version is - **BLUE**
new version is    - **GREEN**

testing is done on new version and once tests are passed, all the traffic is routed to Green**


This strategies are best implemented with Service Meshes like Istio
