  nodeSelector:
    size: large

### nodeSelector is used to constrain a pod to only be able to run on a particular node or set of nodes

## kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>
# example: kubectl label nodes node-1 size=large

## if we want to assign multiple labels say large or medium size nodes??? to achieve that we can use node affinity
